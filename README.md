# Introducing SmartyJS

Smarty is built to help educators easily create pure HTML + JS interactive learning solutions for the online learning environment. It's intended to be easy enough to implement that even non-coders can use it.

Smarty transforms simple HTML markup into beautiful, interactive learning tools. Gone are the days of relying on Flash in order to create an interactive experience for online learners. Unlike Flash, Smarty is also designed with accessibility in mind with the goal to provide an equal experience for all online learners regardless of their needs.

## Setting Up SmartyJS

Setting up Smarty is easier than you think.


1. Download the latest version of SmartyJS for use in your project.

2. Link to the SmartyJS stylesheet in the `<head>` of your document:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/smarty.min.css">
    ```

3. Since SmartyJS is dependent on *jQuery* (v1.12.3+), be sure to load it into your document:

    ```html
    <script src="jquery/jquery-1.12.3.min.js"></script>
    ```

4. After jQuery is loaded, include your local copy of SmartyJS:

    ```html
    <script scr="js/smarty.min.js"></script>
    ```

5. Refer to the **Getting Started** documentation to learn more about how to use SmartyJS.
